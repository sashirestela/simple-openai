It can be demonstrated by assuming a finite list of primes, multiplying them together, and adding one. The resulting number is either prime itself or has prime factors not in the original list, contradicting the assumption of finiteness. Thus, primes cannot be limited to a finite set, proving their infinitude."}],"role":"assistant"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"previous_response_id":null,"reasoning":{"effort":null,"summary":null},"service_tier":"default","store":true,"temperature":0.1,"text":{"format":{"type":"text"}},"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[],"top_p":1.0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":35,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":77,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"total_tokens":112},"user":null,"metadata":{}}
