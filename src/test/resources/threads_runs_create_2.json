It serves as the country's cultural, economic, and political center. Founded by Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535, as \"Ciudad de los Reyes\" (City of the Kings), Lima became the capital of the Vice-royalty of Peru and served as a major Spanish colonial outpost.\n\nThe city has a rich history, with its historic center designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its well-preserved colonial architecture, which includes grand churches, monasteries, and palaces. Modern Lima is a vibrant metropolis, known for its diverse gastronomy blending indigenous, Spanish, African, and Asian influences. The city is also a hub for the arts, hosting numerous museums, galleries, and cultural festivals. Lima acts as the main gateway to other tourist destinations in Peru, like Machu Picchu and the Amazon rainforest.","annotations":[]}}],"attachments":[],"metadata":{}},{"id":"msg_cBNtmwsGJUEYL5omw1pWzYVS","object":"thread.message","created_at":1714853344,"assistant_id":null,"thread_id":"thread_DWFcoAFxKqpNR8MKplqFREzl","run_id":null,"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":{"value":"Tell me something brief about Lima, Peru.","annotations":[]}}],"attachments":[],"metadata":{}}],"first_id":"msg_hcadNESPWWD2waVyxngdeCOi","last_id":"msg_cBNtmwsGJUEYL5omw1pWzYVS","has_more":false}
