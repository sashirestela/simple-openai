Appointment of New Prime Minister**\n\nOn May 14, 2025, President Dina Boluarte appointed Eduardo Arana Ysa as the new Prime Minister of Peru. Arana, previously serving as the Minister of Justice and Human Rights, resigned from his position to assume this role. His appointment follows the resignation of former Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianz√©n, who stepped down ahead of a scheduled no-confidence vote in Congress. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Arana_Ysa?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. Indigenous Communities Celebrate Halt of Oil Drilling Project**\n\nIndigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon have expressed relief after a planned oil drilling project on their ancestral lands failed to attract any bids. The contested area, known as Block 64, overlaps with the territories of the Achuar, Wampis, and Chapra nations. Despite Petroperu, the state oil company, claiming local support, strong opposition from Indigenous groups and environmental concerns have deterred multinational companies from developing the block.

China Grants Visa-Free Entry to Peru**\n\nChina has announced a one-year visa-free policy for nationals of Peru, effective from June 1, 2025. This initiative aims to strengthen ties between China and Latin American countries, including Peru, by facilitating travel and promoting closer economic and diplomatic relationships.
