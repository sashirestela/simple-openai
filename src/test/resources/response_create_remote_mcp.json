This is evident in how you define an API service, such as `PostService`, using annotations like `@Resource`, `@GET`, `@POST`, `@Query`, and `@Body` to specify the endpoint, HTTP method, and parameters. \n\n2.  **Simplicity**: `cleverclient` aims to provide an intuitive API to reduce the complexity of HTTP interactions.  For instance, after defining the annotated interface, making API calls is as simple as calling methods on the created proxy instance. \n\n3.  **Flexibility**: The library supports multiple HTTP client implementations and configuration options.  It abstracts away the underlying HTTP client, allowing you to choose between Java's built-in `HttpClient` (via `JavaHttpClientAdapter`) and Square's `OkHttp` (via `OkHttpClientAdapter`) without changing your client code. \n\n4.  **Extensibility**: `cleverclient` provides various extension points, such as interceptors and adapters, for customization.  You can configure `requestInterceptor` to modify requests before sending them and `responseInterceptor` to modify responses after receiving them.  Additionally, it integrates a retry mechanism through `RetryConfig` and `RetryableRequest` for handling transient failures. \n\n## Core Components and Their Role in the Philosophy\n\nThe design philosophy is implemented through several core components:\n\n*   **`CleverClient`**: This is the main entry point for the library, providing a builder pattern for configuration and a method to create proxy implementations of annotated interfaces.  It allows you to set the base URL, headers, and configure interceptors, retry policies, and the specific `HttpClientAdapter` to use. \n\n*   **`HttpProcessor`**: This component is responsible for creating dynamic proxies of annotated interfaces and processing method invocations. It acts as an `InvocationHandler`, intercepting method calls and converting them into HTTP requests. \n\n*   **`HttpClientAdapter`**: This abstract class defines the common interface for all HTTP client implementations, embodying the flexibility principle. Concrete implementations like `JavaHttpClientAdapter` and `OkHttpClientAdapter` handle the actual HTTP communication using their respective underlying libraries.  The `HttpClientAdapter` also integrates the `RetryableRequest` for the retry mechanism. \n\n*   **Annotations**: Annotations like `@Resource`, `@GET`, `@POST`, `@Path`, `@Query`, and `@Body` are central to the declarative nature of the library, allowing you to define API endpoints and parameters directly on interfaces. \n\n## Request Processing Flow\n\nThe request processing flow illustrates how these principles are put into practice:\n\n1.  You create a `CleverClient` instance and use it to create a proxy of your annotated service interface. \n2.  When you call a method on this proxy, the `HttpProcessor` intercepts the call. \n3.  The `HttpProcessor` then builds the URL and prepares the request based on the annotations. \n4.  If configured, request interceptors are applied. \n5.  The request is then passed to the chosen `HttpClientAdapter` (e.g., `JavaHttpClientAdapter` or `OkHttpClientAdapter`). \n6.  If a `RetryConfig` is present, the `HttpClientAdapter` wraps the request execution in `RetryableRequest` logic, handling retries with exponential backoff and jitter. \n7.  The underlying HTTP client executes the request. \n8.  Upon receiving a response, response interceptors are applied. \n9.  Finally, the `HttpProcessor` converts the response into the expected return type, and the result is returned to your application. \n\nThis flow demonstrates the separation of concerns and the flexibility provided by the adapter pattern and interceptors, allowing for a clean and customizable HTTP client experience.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe `cleverclient` library also provides support for WebSocket interactions, following a similar adapter pattern with `WebSocketAdapter`, `JavaHttpWebSocketAdapter`, and `OkHttpWebSocketAdapter`.  While related to client-side communication, the user's query specifically asked about the \"design philosophy of the cleverclient library,\" which is primarily articulated in the \"Overview\" wiki page and `README.md` in the context of HTTP client functionality.\n\nWiki pages you might want to explore:\n- [Overview (sashirestela/cleverclient)](/wiki/sashirestela/cleverclient#1)\n- [Client Adapters (sashirestela/cleverclient)](/wiki/sashirestela/cleverclient#3.3)\n\nView this search on DeepWiki: https://deepwiki.com/search/what-is-the-design-philosophy_b705345f-848d-424a-a2ff-657ae41d255e\n","server_label":"deepwiki"},{"id":"msg_6840fb94a1048199b15812171a1b9e64002b66fb96599a07","type":"message","status":"completed","content":[{"type":"output_text","annotations":[],"text":"The design philosophy of the `sashirestela/cleverclient` library focuses on simplifying HTTP and WebSocket interactions in Java through a declarative, flexible, and extensible approach.
