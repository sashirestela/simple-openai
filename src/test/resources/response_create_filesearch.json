This means they activate multiple smaller models (referred to as \"experts\") at different times, enhancing performance while reducing computational costs. This approach allows for smaller and more cost-effective models that can perform equally well or better than traditional transformer-based models.\n\n2. **Open Source Nature**: Many of Mistral's models are open source, allowing users to access, modify, and adapt the code and data, including the weights learned during training. This transparency enables users to implement their own optimizations and fine-tuning.\n\n3. **Function Calling Capabilities**: Mistral's models can integrate with other platforms and perform tasks beyond their original capabilities, enhancing their versatility and efficiency.\n\n4. **Multilingual Proficiency**: Most of Mistral's models are fluent in multiple languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian, which allows for nuanced understanding and complex multilingual reasoning tasks.\n\nThese features collectively position Mistral AI as a competitive player in the generative AI landscape, focusing on accessibility and performance."}],"role":"assistant"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"previous_response_id":null,"reasoning":{"effort":null,"summary":null},"service_tier":"default","store":true,"temperature":0.1,"text":{"format":{"type":"text"}},"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[{"type":"file_search","filters":null,"max_num_results":2,"ranking_options":{"ranker":"auto","score_threshold":0.8},"vector_store_ids":["vs_682911d3a8b081919ef72d7110245fa9"]}],"top_p":1.0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":3657,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":326,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"total_tokens":3983},"user":null,"metadata":{}}
